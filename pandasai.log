You generated this python code:
df = dfs[0]
hotel_ratings = df['avg_rating'].value_counts()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
hotel_ratings.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Hotel Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show(block=True)

Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 Identify the most frequently mentioned words in the reviews.

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.
